# Adaptive Inventory Management System

â€œSmarter inventory, smarter business."
An intelligent, adaptive inventory solution that optimizes stock handling, predicts restocking needs, and gives actionable insights to businesses of all sizes.










# Project Overview

Managing inventory can be a challenge â€“ low stock, overstock, and inefficient tracking can cost businesses millions. This system solves that by:

Automating stock updates in real-time

Predicting restocking needs using adaptive trends

Providing actionable analytics for smart decisions

Securing operations with role-based access

Itâ€™s not just inventory managementâ€”itâ€™s inventory intelligence.

# Key Features

Product & Stock Management â€“ Add, update, track, and monitor products efficiently

Order Management â€“ Seamlessly handle purchase & sales orders

Intelligent Product Order Alerts â€“ Get notified when stock falls below thresholds

Employee Roles â€“ Manage access and responsibilities securely

Analytics Dashboard â€“ Insights on stock turnover, sales trends, and performance

Adaptive Recommendations â€“ Learn inventory patterns for smarter restocking

Unstructured Data Parsing - Parsing the sale data into structured json response using LLM Service that uses Mistral Model of Ollama

Scheduled Order Generations - Everyday it checks the products which have stock quantity lesser than their threshold

Role Based Access - Using JWT role based access is enabled

Redis Integration - Using redis rather than DB to reduce response time for blacklisted token checking
